# PM_AC_Drive
Permanent Magnet AC Drive Analysis

This project analyzes a PMAC drive model using Matlab/Simulink. First, two scripts were run to calculate parameters that characterize a PMAC machine, such as Torque, electric power voltage, and current in the d and q axis. Additionally, a comparison between these two scripts and the Simulink was made to corroborate the model's validity. Most of the explanations and analyses are based on figures, graphs, and formulas studied through classes
